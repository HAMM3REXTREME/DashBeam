# DashBeam
### WORK IN PROGRESS
Cross Platform BeamNG OutGauge UI.       
## Usage
Enable OutGauge protocol in BeamNG settings. Use the IP address of the device running DashBeam. You can find your IP address in the DashBeam settings.    
## Building
Open the project in Qt Creator (Need Qt Quick 6.5 or above)    
## TODO   
- Individual `signal`s when a setting is changed, in order to instantly apply the new setting instead of a needing a restart.    
- More customizability, like options to change fonts, colors, or between metric and imperial units    
- Multiple dashboard types (racecar-inspired etc.)    
- Main menu to load a dashboard type.    
- Support for more/custom protocols? Will need a custom mod for BeamNG.Drive.   
- Option to load a custom `.qml` file from a folder at runtime, to allow for user-made dashboard styles.
